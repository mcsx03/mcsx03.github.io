Starting to see Darkgate emails again. They're back to using AutoIt Script with some interesting twist to get there. Here's the breakdown of a sample I went through.

Email came in with a html attachment (attachment name: reports_[0-9]{6}.html):
<a href="Screenshots/05_24_DG1.png"> 
<img src="Screenshots/05_24_DG1.png">
</a>
HTML loads data to the clipboard then displays a second pages asking the users to open powershell and past: the code
<a href="Screenshots/05_24_DG2.png"> 
<img src="Screenshots/05_24_DG2.png">
</a>
<a href="Screenshots/05_25_DG2_1.png"> 
<img src="Screenshots/05_25_DG2_1.png">
</a>
Here's the data from the clipboard. Using CyberChef, I used reverse and from base64:
<a href="Screenshots/05_24_DG3.png">

</a>
Which contains more base64 encoding:
<a href="Screenshots/05_24_DG4.png"> 
<img src="Screenshots/05_24_DG4.png">
</a>
Now we can see it's downloading a HTA file. Not giving any secrets away with the naming:
<a href="Screenshots/05_24_DG5.png"> 
<img src="Screenshots/05_24_DG5.png">
</a>
HTA file is downloading a zip file using powershell. In this command it also unzips the file to c:/zkdz and runs the AutoIt script:

</a>
The AutoIt script then connects to the c2, in this case dogmupdate[.]com | 94[.]158[.]244[.]112
