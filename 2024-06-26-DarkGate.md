Seeing DarkGate again, using PDF attachments that download a VBS file. The VBS file contains an encoded zip file with the AutoIt executable and AutoIt script. Here are a few screenshots and IOCs from today's campaign.


The email had an HTML attachment. All attachments followed the pattern 26_june_[A-z]{2}[0-9]{4}.pdf.

After removing the comments, the script's intent becomes clearer.

However, it's searching for a commented section that contains a hexadecimal string.

I re-added the comments and located the embedded zip file.
